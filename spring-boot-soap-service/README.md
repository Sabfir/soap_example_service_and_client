<br/>
Once you run this SOAP server project, you will get the WSDL from http://localhost:8080/service/studentDetailsWsdl.wsdl. Download the WSDL somewhere as studentDetailsWsdl.wsdl and later we will place this in resources/wsdl folder of the client project which we will create next to generate the client proxy code.

## Technology Stack
- JDK 1.8, Maven – Development environment
- Spring-boot – Underlying application framework
- maven-jaxb2-plugin plugin – for JAXB stub generation
- Spring-boot Command Line Runner – To test the client code
